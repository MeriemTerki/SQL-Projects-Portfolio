A collection of SQL projects to make in practice the needed skills in SQL as a data professional

## 1. Video Game Analysis Project

### Introduction
 This project aims to explore and analyze the top-selling video games between 1977 and 2020, shedding light on trends, critical reception, and user preferences. 
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the gaming industry, focusing on the top 400 best-selling video games. It comprises two tables: `game_sales` and `reviews`. The `game_sales` table contains information about the games, including the name, platform, publisher, developer, copies sold, and release year. The `reviews` table includes critic and user scores for each game.

### Objectives
1. **Top Selling Games**: Identify and list the top ten best-selling video games of all time.
2. **Missing Review Scores**: Address the limitation of missing review scores for some games and quantify the extent of this issue.
3. **Years That Critics Loved**: Explore the years that received the highest average critic scores, indicating potential golden ages for video games.
4. **Verification of Critic Favorites**: Investigate the suspiciously round average critic scores and determine if certain years had fewer reviewed games, impacting the averages.
5. **Years That Dropped Off Critics' Favorites List**: Identify years that dropped off the list of critic favorites due to having four or fewer reviewed games.
6. **Years Video Game Players Loved**: Analyze the average user scores by year to understand the preferences of players.
7. **Years That Both Players and Critics Loved**: Identify years that appear in both the top ten critic and user reviews, signifying universally acclaimed years.
8. **Sales in the Best Video Game Years**: Examine the total game sales for the years that received acclaim from both critics and players.

### Key Learning
- SQL Syntax: Understanding and utilizing SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
- SQL Functions: Utilizing functions such as `AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `ROUND` for aggregating and summarizing data.
- SQL Joins: Joining tables to combine information from different sources and facilitate comprehensive analysis.
- Set Operations: Employing set operations like `EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` to compare and contrast datasets.
