## Video Game Analysis Project 🎮

#### Introduction 🕹️
This project dives into the realm of top-selling video games from 1977 to 2020, unraveling trends, critical reception, and player preferences. The dataset, featuring the top 400 best-selling games, unveils insights through game sales and comprehensive reviews.

#### Dataset 📊
The dataset is a treasure trove from the gaming industry, spotlighting the top 400 best-selling video games. Two tables, `game_sales` and `reviews`, provide a comprehensive view. `game_sales` showcases game details like name, platform, sales, and release year. The `reviews` table unfolds critic and user scores for a holistic analysis.

#### Objectives 🚀
1. **Top Selling Games**: Uncover and celebrate the top ten best-selling video games of all time.
2. **Missing Review Scores**: Address the mystery of missing review scores for some games.
3. **Years That Critics Loved**: Time-travel through the years with the highest average critic scores, seeking the golden age of gaming.
4. **Verification of Critic Favorites**: Uncover the truth behind suspiciously round average critic scores, delving into the number of reviewed games.
5. **Years That Dropped Off Critics' Favorites List**: Discover the overlooked years due to minimal game reviews.
6. **Years Video Game Players Loved**: Decode player preferences through average user scores by year.
7. **Years That Both Players and Critics Loved**: Identify the golden years that captured both critic and player hearts.
8. **Sales in the Best Video Game Years**: Peek into the financial success of years cherished by critics and players alike.

#### Key Learning 🧠
- **SQL Syntax**: Mastering SQL queries for effective data retrieval and analysis.
- **SQL Functions**: Employing functions like `AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `ROUND` for insightful data summaries.
- **SQL Joins**: Weaving together information from diverse sources with join operations.
- **Set Operations**: Playing with set operations (`EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT`) for nuanced dataset comparisons.
