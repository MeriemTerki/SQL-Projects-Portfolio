## 1. Video Game Analysis Project

### Introduction
Video games have become a significant part of the entertainment industry, with a global market projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027. This project aims to explore and analyze the top-selling video games between 1977 and 2020, shedding light on trends, critical reception, and user preferences. The dataset used in this project consists of information on game sales, including the number of copies sold, and reviews data, including critic and user scores.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the gaming industry, focusing on the top 400 best-selling video games. It comprises two tables: `game_sales` and `reviews`. The `game_sales` table contains information about the games, including the name, platform, publisher, developer, copies sold, and release year. The `reviews` table includes critic and user scores for each game.

### Objectives
1. **Top Selling Games**: Identify and list the top ten best-selling video games of all time.
2. **Missing Review Scores**: Address the limitation of missing review scores for some games and quantify the extent of this issue.
3. **Years That Critics Loved**: Explore the years that received the highest average critic scores, indicating potential golden ages for video games.
4. **Verification of Critic Favorites**: Investigate the suspiciously round average critic scores and determine if certain years had fewer reviewed games, impacting the averages.
5. **Years That Dropped Off Critics' Favorites List**: Identify years that dropped off the list of critic favorites due to having four or fewer reviewed games.
6. **Years Video Game Players Loved**: Analyze the average user scores by year to understand the preferences of players.
7. **Years That Both Players and Critics Loved**: Identify years that appear in both the top ten critic and user reviews, signifying universally acclaimed years.
8. **Sales in the Best Video Game Years**: Examine the total game sales for the years that received acclaim from both critics and players.

### Key Learning
- SQL Syntax: Understanding and utilizing SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
- SQL Functions: Utilizing functions such as `AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `ROUND` for aggregating and summarizing data.
- SQL Joins: Joining tables to combine information from different sources and facilitate comprehensive analysis.
- Set Operations: Employing set operations like `EXCEPT` and `INTERSECT` to compare and contrast datasets.

### Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the best-selling and most critically acclaimed video games, highlighting potential golden ages in the gaming industry. By considering both critic and user perspectives, this project aims to offer a comprehensive view of the video game landscape, identifying years that stand out in terms of sales and reception.
